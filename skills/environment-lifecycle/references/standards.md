# Severity and Verdict Vocabulary

Canonical severity levels and verdict vocabulary for every skill in the suite.

## Severity levels

- **P0 Blocker:** unsafe, impossible, materially incorrect, data/security/production risk.
- **P1 Critical:** blocks first success, breaks a hard gate (magic path, local dev), or incorrectly documents a public contract.
- **P2 Major:** important missing workflow, stale example, API/SDK mismatch, poor error recovery, substantial drift.
- **P3 Minor:** clarity, navigation, terminology, maintainability.
- **P4 Polish:** presentation/style only.

Prioritize defects that prevent developers from succeeding over cosmetic completeness.

## Verdict vocabulary

Every release or audit verdict returns exactly one of:

- **PASS:** no P0/P1 gate failures; required hard gates pass.
- **PASS WITH DEBT:** no hard gate failure, but P2/P3 backlog remains.
- **FAIL:** one or more P0/P1 gates fail.
- **UNVERIFIED:** evidence is insufficient to prove critical gates; do not convert this to PASS based on assumptions.

A high numerical score cannot override a hard-gate failure.

## Report labeling

Every score and timing reported by any skill must carry its evidence label (Observed / CI-observed / Estimated). Unlabeled numbers are UNVERIFIED.

## Evidence hierarchy

Prefer, in order:

1. observed execution against a clean/representative environment
2. implementation/tests/specs
3. generated/current interface output such as `--help`
4. package/release metadata
5. examples
6. prose docs

When sources disagree, report the contradiction.


## Gate identifiers

| Gate constant | Severity | Fails when |
|---|---|---|
| `BROKEN_QUICKSTART` | P1 | magic path exceeds `MAGIC_PATH_MAX_MIN`, no reproducible end-to-end quickstart exists, or manual approval/support is required with no sandbox route |
| `NON_REPRODUCIBLE_BUILD` | P1 | a clean checkout cannot reach the productive state within `LOCAL_DEV_MAX_MIN` using only committed instructions/automation |
| `UNEXPLAINED_ERROR` | P1 | a public, expected error lacks what happened / why / where / how to fix / retry-safety, or a support-correlation identifier |
| `UNDOCUMENTED_BREAKING_API` | P0 | a breaking API/CLI/config change ships without changelog entry and migration guidance |
| `SDK_API_DRIFT` | P1 | a released official SDK is missing operations or contradicts the canonical API |
| `UNTESTED_SUPPORTED_VERSION` | P1 | a version/platform is claimed supported without CI or equivalent evidence |
| `STALE_PUBLIC_REFERENCE` | P1 | generated reference observably disagrees with current behavior |
| `UNSAFE_EXAMPLES` | P1 | security-sensitive examples encourage unsafe credential handling |
| `BROKEN_CANONICAL_INSTALL` | P1 | canonical install/auth path is broken |


## Evidence labels

- **Observed**: a human or agent actually executed the path from a clean or representative environment.
- **CI-observed**: automation executed the product steps; may undercount human reading/signup time.
- **Estimated**: steps analyzed but not executed.
- An estimate can never prove a PASS. A metric without an evidence label is UNVERIFIED.
